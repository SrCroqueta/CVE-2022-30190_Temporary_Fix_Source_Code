# **_ðŸ©¹CVE-2022-30190 Temporary FixðŸ©¹ (Source Code)_**
These are the source codes of two Python scripts compiled to easily and quickly apply temporary protection against the **_CVE-2022-30190 vulnerability (Follina)_**

Both can be programmed better, but this is just to implement it as quickly as possible and I did it without much Python knowledge, but the important part is... **_it works!_** Hehe

## _What do these '.exe' files do?:_

> Step by step (**_'CVE-2022-30190_temp-fix.py'_** [CVE-2022-30190_temp-fix.exe]):
  1. Backs up the registry key **_'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt'_**.
  2. Deletes the registry key **_'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt'_**.
  3. Creates a new registry key **_'DWORD'_** with a value of **_'0'_** to enable a **_'Local Group Policy'_** at the path **_'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\ScriptedDiagnostics'_** called **_'EnableDiagnostics'_** (This registry key sets the policy called **_'Troubleshooting: Allow users to access and run troubleshooting wizards.'_** as **_'Disabled'_**, located at **_'Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/System/Troubleshooting and Diagnostics/Scripted Diagnostics'_**).

> Step by step (**_'CVE-2022-30190_back-to-normal.py'_** [revert_changes.exe]):
  1. Restores the registry key **_'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt'_**.
  2. Deletes **_'.reg'_** file used to restore it.
  3. Deletes the registry key which was created before to enable a **_'Local Group Policy'_**.

## _How to use them:_

- Run **_'CVE-2022-30190_temp-fix.exe'_** as **_administrator_**, that's all.

- **Do not delete the _'.reg'_ file generated because you will need it in the future when Microsoft fixes this vulnerability.**

- If you want to undo all changes made, you just have to run **_'revert_changes.exe'_** as **_administrator_**.

## _My antivirus detected it as a threat?:_

> In most cases it will detected by the AV as a **_threat_**, so you can **add an _exception_** or just **_disable_ it for a moment**, this is because none of the '.exe' files are signed.
