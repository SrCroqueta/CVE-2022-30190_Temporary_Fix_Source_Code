# **_ðŸ©¹CVE-2022-30190 Temporary FixðŸ©¹ (Source Code)_**
These are the source codes of the Python scripts to apply the temporary protection against the **_CVE-2022-30190 vulnerability (Follina)_**

Both can be programmed better, but this is just to implement it as quickly as possible and I did it with no much knowledge on Python, but the important is, **_it works!_** Hehe

## _What these files do?:_

> Step by step (**_'CVE-2022-30190_temp-fix.py'_** [**_'CVE-2022-30190_temp-fix.exe'_**]):
  1. It backup the registry key **_'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt'_**.
  2. Deletes the registry key **_'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt'_**.
  3. Creates a new registry key of a **_'DWORD'_** with a value of **_'0'_** to enable a **_'Local Security Policy'_** on the path **_'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\ScriptedDiagnostics'_** called **_'EnableDiagnostics'_**.

> Step by step (**_'CVE-2022-30190_back-to-normal.py'_** [**_'revert_changes.exe'_**]):
  1. It restore the registry key **_'HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ms-msdt'_**.
  2. Deletes **_'.reg'_** file used to restore it.
  3. Deletes the registry key which as been created before to enable a **_'Local Security Policy'_**.

## _How to use:_

- Download it from here: [CVE-2022-30190 Temp Fix](https://github.com/SrCroqueta/CVE-2022-30190_Temporary_Fix).

- Run **_'CVE-2022-30190_temp-fix.exe'_** as **_administrator_**, that's all.

- **Do not delete the _'.reg'_ file generated because you will need it in the future when Microsoft fix this vulnerability definitely.**

- If you want to undo all changes you just have to run **_'revert_changes.exe'_** as **_administrator_**.

## _AV (AntiVirus) detected it as a threat?:_

> In most cases it will detected by the AV (AntiVirus) as a **_threat_**, so you can **add an _exception_** or just **_disable_ it for a moment**, this is because none of the '.exe' files are signed.
